# 8-Week-SQL-Challenge

## Case Study #1 - Danny's Diner

Danny wants to use the data to answer a few simple questions about his customers, especially about their visiting patterns, how much money they’ve spent and also which menu items are their favourite. Having this deeper connection with his customers will help him deliver a better and more personalised experience for his loyal customers.

He plans on using these insights to help him decide whether he should expand the existing customer loyalty program - additionally he needs help to generate some basic datasets so his team can easily inspect the data without needing to use SQL.

Danny has provided you with a sample of his overall customer data due to privacy issues - but he hopes that these examples are enough for you to write fully functioning SQL queries to help him answer his questions!

Danny has shared with you 3 key datasets for this case study:

sales
menu
members

All Database Code, Questions and Answers are shared in the Week-1 File.


## Case Study #2 - Pizza Runner
Because Danny had a few years of experience as a data scientist - he was very aware that data collection was going to be critical for his business’ growth.

He has prepared for us an entity relationship diagram of his database design but requires further assistance to clean his data and apply some basic calculations so he can better direct his runners and optimise Pizza Runner’s operations.

All datasets exist within the pizza_runner database schema - be sure to include this reference within your SQL scripts as you start exploring the data and answering the case study questions.

This case study has LOTS of questions - they are broken up by area of focus including:

Pizza Metrics
Runner and Customer Experience
Ingredient Optimisation
Pricing and Ratings
Bonus DML Challenges (DML = Data Manipulation Language)
Each of the following case study questions can be answered using a single SQL statement.

Again, there are many questions in this case study - please feel free to pick and choose which ones you’d like to try!

Before you start writing your SQL queries however - you might want to investigate the data, you may want to do something with some of those null values and data types in the customer_orders and runner_orders tables!


All Database Code, Questions and Answers are shared in the Week-2 File.
